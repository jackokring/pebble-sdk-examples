This source is free to use with proper acknowledgement of the author. The game and watch is easy
to understand, and should not need changing much. The stopwatch uses a time subtraction method of 
aparently working while the app is suspended. This is to keep the worker thread to provide other
functionality, such as running some backgound code. This limits the accuracy to within 1 second
of button pushes, and with a 40 day return to zero count. If the count goes past a new year,
the leap year status is checked. The stopwatch will stop and reset before 2 years.

The settings page in the app displays the help. I hope you enjoy!
