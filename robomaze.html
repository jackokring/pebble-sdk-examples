<h3>Modes</h3>
<b>Clock</b> This mode shows the time. Pressing <b>BACK</b> changes mode.
<b>Date</b> This mode shows the date. It returns to time after a few seconds.
<b>Stopwatch</b> This is a second accurate counter. <b>UP</b> is lap and reset, while <b>DOWN</b>
is start and stop. The stopwatch will stop running sometime after one year, and will loop every 960 hours.
This keeps it day synchronized over long time scales. It still counts when the watch loses power.
Uninstallation clears the persistant memory, and so resets the stopwatch.
<b>Calculator</b> The <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> buttons increase or decrese the unit digit, and a long press does
a multiply or divide by ten. Long pressing <b>SELECT</b> sets up exponents, with long presses for the tens digit
of the exponent. A short press of <b>SELECT</b>, sets up function entry.[in dev].
<b>Game</b> The <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> buttons, when not in stopwatch or calculator mode, select game A/B.
When in game mode, the <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN</b> buttons, select the anticlockwise and clockwise player motion
preference, as indicated by the dot next to the score. <b>H</b> and <b>L</b> are displayed when the hiscore and
level are displayed. Pressing <b>BACK</b> in game mode goes back to time, and plays the game passively in the
background. [in dev].
The <b>SELECT</b> button enters the console mode. The console has a different context based on the mode.[in dev].
