Welcome to My Examples for Pebble.</h3>

<p>I have added a number of extra examples from a cloned repository. It therefore does not include the latest Pebble examples from Pebble. The extra examples built by me are listed below. Some may be under active development.</p>

<h3>
Log Clock</h3>

<p>The watch face displays the time. It was my first face developed from Simplicity to which I added GPS co-ordinates and a cycle of log and arc tangent tables for potential navigation. X is input L is scaled log, and A is 45 degree scaled arc tangent. The gradients are also included, and the are scaled a number of decimal places to fit the maximum value. The T and E are the Reverse gradients when looking up a reverse value of X. There is no active development on this, just any bug fixes if you find a bug.</p>

<h3>
RoboMaze</h3>

<p>This is a watch app, where the BACK button works as a mode select for the display. You must long press the BACK button to exit. This app is under active development. Circa October 2015 there is a clock, a date mode (with automatic return to clock), a stopwatch mode with one second accuracy (but the app does not have to be running to count, and even the battery can be flat and it will still 'count'). The DOWN button is start/stop, and the UP button is lap/reset. The BACK button cycles through the modes.</p>

<h4>Under Development</h4>
<p>A calculation mode and a gaming mode which can be seen (as developed so far) after the stopwatch in the mode sequence, or by pressing UP or DOWN when not in calculation or stopwatch mode. Further information here as development happens. Pressing the SELECT button in any mode brings up the consoole display, which shows all zeros circa 2015.</p>
